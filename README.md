# Rossmann Store Sales Forecast using R
For this challenge, we are given records of sales of each store on different dates of Rossmann, a Germany drug store chain with over 3790 stores in Europe, from 01/01/2013 to 31/07/2015. Sales can be affected by many factors such as holidays, promotions and competitions. Our goal is to explore the correlations between these features using R and utilize the results of this exploratory data analysis to build a linear regression model that predicts the store sales from 08/01/2015 to 09/17/2015, 6 weeks in advance.

## What inspired us to make this?
In Summer 2020, we, a Chemical Engineering/ Supply Chain major and a Quantitative Economics + Music Performance major teamed up to work on our first-ever data analytics project. While we came from completely different backgrounds, we shared a genuine interest in strengthening our skills in analyzing data and modeling. After spending some time on Kaggle.com, we came across this challenge that fitted both of our academic interests: Rossmann Store Sales (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

## How did we tackle this project?
We started with cleaning the raw data and explored the correlation between different features. With this first step, we found some interesting insights, which we used to build our model. Lastly, we validated the model that achieved a good accuracy and provided deliverables.

## What challenges did we face?
We had a hard time choosing the desired visualization tools for the data exploration portion and determined the suitable predicted model for the data.

## What accomplishments are we proud of?
We completeted our first data analytics project by self-learning R and remotely collaborating with each other.

## What did we learn from this project?
We learned how to use R to clean and analyze data, build forcasting model, and better undertand statistical concepts in this practice.

## Special thanks
We would like to thank Phuong Nguyen for connecting us and guilding us through this project and Hieu Nguyen for giving us feedback for improvements.
